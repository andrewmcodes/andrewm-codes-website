I currently work for [N2 Publishing](https://n2pub.com/) as a software developer. I also am a co-host of the Remote Ruby podcast with Chris Oliver and Jason Charnes.

I am currently excited about:

- [BridgetownRB](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/)
- Organization
- [Falcon](https://github.com/socketry/falcon)
- [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/)
