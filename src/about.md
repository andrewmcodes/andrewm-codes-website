### Bio

Andrew Mason is a tool builder who is passionate about developer communities and mentoring. Though still early in his career, he's had a lot of experience on all levels of the stack, as well as dev advocacy and community management. In mid-2019, he met Nate Hopkins through The Ruby Rogues podcast, which led to his early involvement in [StimulusReflex](https://github.com/hopsoft/stimulus_reflex). He would later join Nate Hopkins at [CodeFund](https://github.com/gitcoinco/code_fund_ads), where he rose to become the primary developer until the platform was forced to shutdown. It was at [CodeFund](https://github.com/gitcoinco/code_fund_ads) with Nate, Eric Berry, and Justin Dorfman where he discovered his passion for open source software and working in public.

He is a core member of [StimulusReflex](https://github.com/hopsoft/stimulus_reflex), founding member of [BridgetownRB](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown), and even [fixed a typo in Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/commit/e475b61e3f28e7bfcf89f1adf16c9f800fdbfaf0). In his free time, Andrew enjoys making digital art, collecting tools, pairing with juniors, and surfing.
