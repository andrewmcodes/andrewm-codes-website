> Heads up! This is not _actually_ a deep dive ðŸ˜¬

With everything going on in the world, I almost forgot how fun it can be to code in Ruby! I am not being sarcastic, its _actually_ really fun!

## What kind of fun?

Earlier, I was reviewing some code in a PR to [Bridgetown](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown), and I came across this change:

{% raw %}```diff

- static_template_files << "/Gemfile"

* static_template_files.push "/Gemfile", "/package.json"

````{% endraw %}

Whenever I see small method changes during code review, I find it a helpful mind exercise to consider whether the method actually *needed* to be changed since there's almost always _a way_ in Ruby. More often than not, this leads me to my favorite type of Ruby: quirky, fun, and a bit magical.

You could even call it *blursed*...ðŸ¤”

And if we are really being honest, blursed Ruby is my favorite type of Ruby.

## {% raw %}`Array# <<`{% endraw %}

Commonly referred to as the "shovel operator", {% raw %}`<<`{% endraw %} is a method in Ruby that is commonly used to push an object onto an array, but you can shovel into strings as well.

For example:

{% raw %}```ruby
["foo", "bar"] << "baz"
# => ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
```{% endraw %}

> Speaking of blursed Ruby, [check out the example code in the docs for {% raw %}`str << int`{% endraw %}](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/String.html# method-i-3C-3C).

## TIL!

Today I {% raw %}`/re(learned|membered)/`{% endraw %} you can chain shovels! Not that you _should_....but just in case, know that you _can_.

The following is a blursed example of just that:

[View gist](https://gist.github.com/andrewmcodes/2e4ba1d60016e065155f0509d3814234)

I realized I was grinning from ear to ear while writing this code. This code will run just fine if you paste it into IRB or Pry, emojis and all! A fun example of what you _can_ do with Ruby, if you wanted to.

## Back to code review

Just because you _can_ do it doesn't mean you should! The readability of swapping the shovel operator with the {% raw %}`Array# push`{% endraw %} method is the right call in my opinion. The change got a green check of approval from me.

But, I couldn't resist sharing my blursed example. Hopefully it makes you grin as well.

As I said at the beginning: it's fun to write Ruby!

Happy coding!
