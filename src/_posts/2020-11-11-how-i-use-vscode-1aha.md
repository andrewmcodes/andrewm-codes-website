I’m about to overhaul my settings and plugins in VSCode so this is my “before” shot.

I recently updated and shared my [Visual Studio Code settings](https://howivscode.com/andrewmcodes) on [How I VSCode](https://howivscode.com).

Check them out and share yours as well!

Really loving this tool because now I can always point people towards tools I like without having to copy it from a gist somewhere or be on my computer.

What plugins are you really enjoying? Any new ones? Which ones do you no longer need as the software matures?

Happy (VS) Coding!
